# Steven Peterson

I build software to make messy real-world processes understandable.

My background is in infrastructure and operational systems. Much of my career has been spent diagnosing why organizations struggle with technology even when the software technically works. Over time I noticed a pattern: the failures were rarely about features and were about workflow clarity.

My independent projects explore a simple question:

> Can software model how work actually happens instead of how documentation claims it happens?

Most of what I build lives somewhere between operations, product design, and development.

## Focus Areas

**Operational clarity**  
Tools that help people understand what is happening inside a system, not just what the final result was.

**Workflow modeling**  
Representing real activities (manufacturing, learning, debugging, administration) as structured processes.

**Human-computer interaction**  
Understanding how people think while using software, especially when tools become complex.

**AI-assisted tooling**  
Designing environments where humans and AI systems can collaborate reliably instead of unpredictably.

## Selected Projects

### PlasticOS
Manufacturing operations platform modeling inventory, machine wear, maintenance, and true production cost for small fabrication businesses.  
Focus: turning workshop activity into observable operational data.

### Litura
Reading engagement platform that measures comprehension behavior rather than simple book completion.  
Focus: treating reading as a trainable cognitive skill.

### CodeStory
Repository context and documentation system intended to help developers and AI tools understand project structure and intent between sessions.  
Focus: reducing context loss during software development.

### Vibe Coder Starter Kit
A published resource platform documenting structured workflows for independent developers working with AI coding tools.

### Admin-Tools
Automation and operational scripting developed from real production IT environments.  
Focus: reliability, repeatability, and environment visibility.

## What I Care About

I am interested in the space where:
- software meets real operations
- tools meet human behavior
- automation meets trust

Many systems assume ideal conditions: trained users, perfect documentation, stable processes. Real environments rarely look like that.

My work focuses on building tools that remain useful even when reality is inconsistent.

## Current Direction

I am particularly interested in:
- developer tooling
- workflow automation
- implementation engineering
- systems reliability
- AI-assisted software development

I enjoy working on problems that sit between engineering, product, and user experience, especially where the main task is turning an unclear process into a repeatable one.

## Philosophy

Software usually records events after they happen.

The more interesting problem is helping people understand a system *while it is happening*.

If a system is observable, it becomes improvable.

GitHub Issues or Discussions are the best way to start a technical conversation.
